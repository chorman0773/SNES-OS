# SNES-OS
High level Linux-like OS Running on a SNES. The OS is intended to be used with a custom cart with the bios and other requirements.
The exact requirements are not known at this time. Minor Modifications to the SNES Hardware may be necessary.

A modified version of SNES9x will be developed at some point to act as a "Virtual Machine", emulating all of the memory features provided by external components.
